# Protests-in-India

This project is still a work-in-progress. So far, I have used data from ACLED (The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) to create a dataset with event-wise observations on protests, riots and armed conflicts in India between 2016-2020. I have cleaned the data, generated some additonal variables and used reverse-geocoding to obtain a clean state variable to facilitate region/state-wise analysis. Feel free to download the cleaned data in csv format from this repository and use it for your own work! Thank you for your interest :)
