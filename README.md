# Protests-in-India 

In this project, I have used data from ACLED (The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) to create a dataset with event-wise observations on protests, riots and armed conflicts in India between 2016-2020. I have cleaned the data, generated some additonal variables and used reverse-geocoding to obtain an accurate state variable to facilitate region/state-wise analysis. This project is still a work in progress. The cleaned data can be found in the zip folder of this repository.
